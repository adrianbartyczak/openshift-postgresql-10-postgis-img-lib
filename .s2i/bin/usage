cat <<EOF
This is the usage information for a PostGIS extended PostgreSQL 10 image for
OpenShift Origin.

This image can be found at
    https://hub.docker.com/r/adrianbartyczak/openshift-postgresql-10-postgis/
and its packaging library can be found at
    https://github.com/adrianbartyczak/openshift-postgresql-10-postgis-img-lib

This usage information is divided into sections based on an image built with
Docker and an image built with the OpenShift Source-to-image tool (found at
https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image). It is beneficial to understand
that the OpenShift Source-to-image tool adds a paradigm to how an S2I-ready
image (an image containing S2I source files) built with Docker is run as an
OpenShift application image. The OpenShift S2I tool builds the same image
OpenShift Origin builds when a new application is invoked in it with a plain
Docker image. This image runs the S2I source files included in the plain Docker
image or from an S2I source repository built with the plain Docker image. As a
result, an S2I image built with the OpenShift S2I tool can be run mostly as an
OpenShift application image with the "docker run" command. (Note: Running an S2I
image with the "docker run" command will not run the assembly script).

Build the plain Docker image:

  Note: Running the plain Docker image will require manually starting the
        PostgreSQL server inside the resulting container (see section "Run the
        plain Docker image" for more information).

  To build the image as a plain Docker image, change to the directory of the
  packaging library and run the following command:

      docker build --build-arg OPENSHIFT_ORIGIN_USER_ID=<id> -t \
            <docker_image_name>:<docker_image_tag> .

          Note: If the image will not be used with an OpenShift Origin
                application, the build argument can be excluded.
          Note: To get the correct OpenShift Origin user ID, build the image
                without the build argument or using any user ID, run the
                resulting image as an OpenShift Origin application and check the
                logs of the pod that ran the application.

Build the OpenShift S2I image:

  To build the image as an OpenShift Source-To-Image (S2I) image, do the
  following:

    1. Install the OpenShift S2I tool if not already installed.

    2. Build the image as a plain Docker image if not already built.

    3. Run the following command:

           s2i build \
                <s2i_source_repository> \
                <docker_image_name>:<docker_image_tag> \
                <s2i_image_name>:<s2i_image_tag>

               Note: An S2I source repository is required with the s2i build
                     command. Once can be created simply by copying the S2I source
                     files provided in the packaging library of this image to a
                     new repository. Warning: The S2I source repository will
                     override the S2I source files in the image.

Run the plain Docker image:

  To run the plain Docker image, run the following command:

      docker run -t -d <docker_image_name>:<docker_image_tag> bash

          Note: The PostgreSQL server must be started manually as the image was
                not built as an OpenShift S2I image. To start it, run one of the
                following two commands inside the resulting container:

                    1. /usr/pgsql-10/bin/pg_ctl -D /var/lib/postgres/data -l \
                             /var/lib/postgres/data/server.log start

                    2. /usr/pgsql-10/bin/postgres -D /var/lib/postgres/data \
                             >logfile 2>&1 &

Run the OpenShift S2I image:

  To run the OpenShift S2I image, run the following command:

      docker run -d <s2i_image_name>:<s2i_image_tag>


Run the plain Docker image as an OpenShift S2I image:

  The only way to run the plain Docker image as an OpenShift S2I image is to
  invoke a new application with it. This can be done with the following command:

      oc new-app \
            <docker_image_name>:<docker_image_tag> \
            --name=<app_name>
